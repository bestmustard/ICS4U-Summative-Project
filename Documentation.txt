We asked people to answer what kind of app they would want our team to make on multiple social media platform to choose the best idea.

12/04/2018
Many people have submitted a response (ex: soundboard, metronome, guitar tuner, etc.)
Researching which topic is the hardest to program and based on our programming abilities we will decide which idea is best suited for us

Most people would like us to create a soundboard
Running another online survey asking people what kind of sounds they would like (appropriate of course)

Looking for audio clips the clients want on youtube and using a converter to an mp3 file

Victor comes up of the idea of adding a hidden sound where it will play if a certain order of buttons is pressed

Found some audio files 
Using audacity to edit the clips to get a specific part of the sound

We will input 26 different buttons into the application to simulate the different letters of the alphabet
If the user puts in the correct order, a new sound will play rather than the last expected sound
